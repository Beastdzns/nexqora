# Project Name

## Overview

This project integrates mutual fund [different token buying at same tme reducing the gas fees and making the gas fees as low as possible] Chainlink’s CCIP, 1inch Fusion, Eliza OS, and Goat SDK to provide cross-chain interoperability, utilizing Ethereum's EVM and Solidity for smart contract functionality. Additionally, AI-driven decision-making and blockchain communication are enabled through Eliza OS and Goat SDK.

This project integrates Eliza OS and Goat SDK to enable AI-driven interactions with blockchain applications. Eliza OS is an AI agent framework that allows autonomous agents to perform tasks across various platforms, while Goat SDK acts as a plugin, connecting these AI agents to on-chain applications. By combining these technologies, our project enhances the capabilities of decentralized applications, enabling smarter and more efficient cross-chain operations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) (usually installed with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A wallet connected to the supported blockchain networks

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stoners/tokentechies.git
cd tokentechies
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following details:

```env
PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
ELIZA_FRAMEWORK=your_eliza_framework_key
GOAT_SDK=your_goat_sdk_key
GMEINI_KEY=your_gmeini_key
```

- **PROJECT_ID**: The project ID of the blockchain network you're using.
- **ELIZA_FRAMEWORK**: The key for the Eliza AI agent framework.
- **GOAT_SDK**: The key for the Goat SDK, enabling the plugin between AI agents and on-chain apps.
- **GMEINI_KEY**: The key for the wallet or service you're connecting to.

### 4. Connect Your Wallet

You will need to connect your wallet to the supported network. Ensure your wallet is set up and properly connected to interact with the project.

### 5. Run the Project

Once you have completed the setup, run the project with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to interact with the application, and the AI and blockchain systems will work together to enable cross-chain interoperability.

### Further Enhancements

CirclePay allows users to send USDC transactions without handling gas fees by leveraging smart signature technology (EIP-712 & EIP-3009). Users can authorize transfers that others execute later, simplifying cross-chain transfers of digital assets. Wallet connection is required to use the platform.
