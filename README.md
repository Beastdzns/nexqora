# Project Name

## Overview

This project integrates Chainlink’s CCIP, 1inch Fusion, Eliza OS, and Goat SDK to provide cross-chain interoperability, utilizing Ethereum's EVM and Solidity for smart contract functionality. Additionally, AI-driven decision-making and blockchain communication are enabled through Eliza OS and Goat SDK.

This project integrates Eliza OS and Goat SDK to enable AI-driven interactions with blockchain applications. Eliza OS is an AI agent framework that allows autonomous agents to perform tasks across various platforms, while Goat SDK acts as a plugin, connecting these AI agents to on-chain applications. By combining these technologies, our project enhances the capabilities of decentralized applications, enabling smarter and more efficient cross-chain operations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) (usually installed with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A wallet connected to the supported blockchain networks

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stoners/tokentechies.git
cd tokentechies
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following details:

```env
PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
ELIZA_FRAMEWORK=your_eliza_framework_key
GOAT_SDK=your_goat_sdk_key
GMEINI_KEY=your_gmeini_key
```

- **PROJECT_ID**: The project ID of the blockchain network you're using.
- **ELIZA_FRAMEWORK**: The key for the Eliza AI agent framework.
- **GOAT_SDK**: The key for the Goat SDK, enabling the plugin between AI agents and on-chain apps.
- **GMEINI_KEY**: The key for the wallet or service you're connecting to.

### 4. Connect Your Wallet

You will need to connect your wallet to the supported network. Ensure your wallet is set up and properly connected to interact with the project.

### 5. Run the Project

Once you have completed the setup, run the project with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

You should now be able to interact with the application, and the AI and blockchain systems will work together to enable cross-chain interoperability.

The Twilio phone call system integrated into the project allows users to check their account balance and receive transaction updates via voice calls. To use this feature, users need to configure their Twilio credentials, token, and wallet address in the `.env` file. Once set up, the system will call the user and provide information about their balance and recent activities. Additionally, users will receive important messages and notifications related to their blockchain account. This integration offers a convenient, accessible way to stay updated with your account details via phone calls and text messages. 

### Setup for Twilio:

In your `.env` file, include the following:

```env
TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
```

Once configured, the system will use Twilio to call your number and deliver your account information directly.
